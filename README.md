## About Me

I am a Senior Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience building,
maintaining, and supporting enterprise backend systems, mainly within
banking and financial environments.

My core expertise is Java-based backend development using the Spring
ecosystem, with a strong focus on system integration, messaging platforms,
relational databases, and automated testing. I have worked extensively
on production systems where stability, security, and maintainability
are critical.

I am primarily interested in **hands-on technical roles**, contributing
through code quality, system design, and practical problem solving rather
than people management.
